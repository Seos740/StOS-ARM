_start:
    ; Initialize the interrupt controller
    ; ARM does not use PICs in the same way as x86, so this is an abstraction for setting up interrupts.

    ; Disable interrupts (equivalent to `cli` on x86)
    mrs r0, cpsr            ; Get current CPSR (Current Program Status Register)
    orr r0, r0, #0x80       ; Set the interrupt disable bit
    msr cpsr, r0            ; Write back to CPSR to disable interrupts

    ; Configure interrupt controllers (simplified)
    ; In ARM, interrupt controllers are typically configured through memory-mapped registers.
    ; You would configure the GIC (Generic Interrupt Controller) here on ARM.

    ; Enable interrupts (equivalent to `sti` on x86)
    bic r0, r0, #0x80       ; Clear the interrupt disable bit
    msr cpsr, r0            ; Write back to CPSR to enable interrupts

    ; Infinite loop to simulate interrupt handling
wait_for_interrupt:
    wfi                      ; Wait For Interrupt (ARM instruction to put CPU in low power mode until interrupt)
    b wait_for_interrupt     ; Infinite loop, waiting for interrupt

    ; Interrupt handler (simplified)
keyboard_handler:
    ; Handle keyboard interrupt (this part is dependent on how interrupts are managed in your system)
    ; In ARM, you'd read from the specific memory-mapped I/O registers for the keyboard or handle interrupts via the GIC.

    ; Example: Read from keyboard data register (0x60 on x86)
    ; Here we'd typically read from a register based on your platform's I/O or memory-mapped device

    ; Return from interrupt (in ARM, this is `bx lr` to return from an interrupt)
    bx lr                    ; Return from interrupt (this is equivalent to `iret` in x86)
